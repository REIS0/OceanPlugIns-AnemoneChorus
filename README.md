# OceanPlugIns-AnemoneChorus
## A Chorus VST plug-in built using the JUCE Framework

### ![alt text](GUI_export_073119.png)  

This is the first of several plug-ins in a my Ocean Plug-ins Suite.  The actual Chorus effect/DSP is pretty straight-forward, not reinventing the wheel here.  

The GUI is an excercise in design.  I have produced music for several years now, and most plug-ins I am familiar with look like either:
- an existing vintage/classic analog gear
- a component in a spaceship's center console

I chose to design the GUI with water colors and sea creatures to encourage users to approach using this Chorus with a sense of discovery and perhaps a new creative approach, sort of like a child with crayons and a blank piece of paper... 

The actual water color painting was done by my good friend, you can find her art at @peacespells on IG.
